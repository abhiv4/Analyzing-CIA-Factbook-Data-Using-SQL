# Analyzing-CIA-Factbook-Data-Using-SQL

## Aim of the project
In this project, we will use SQL in Jupyter Notebook to analyze data from CIA Factbook database. The goal is to identify the leading and lagging territories of the world based on demographic indicators like population, mortality, and fertility.

## Table of contents
1. Connecting to the CIA factbook database
2. Understanding the schema of the database

    - Let's understand the population distribution in the database
    - 5 most populated countries and their world proportions
    - Countries with the smallest total population
4. Exploring population density
    - Countries with the highest population density
    - Countries with the lowest population density
5. Mortality & Fertility
    - Countries with the highest birth rates
    - Countries with the lowest birth rates
    - Countries with the highest death rates
    - Countries with the lowest death rates
    - Countries with the highest birth-to-death ratio
    - Countries with the lowest birth-to-death ratio
6. Countries with the fastest declining population
7. Conclusion    
8. Limitation
